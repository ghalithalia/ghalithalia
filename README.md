#  Hi, Nice to meet you 

🎓 I’m a dual-degree student in **engineering and business**, currently studying at **EDHEC Business School** and **Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC)**.  
I love working at the intersection of **data**, **design thinking**, and real-world challenges, especially in urban planning, but I'm equally interested in applying these tools to other meaningful domains.
---

##  What I'm interested in:
- Creative, visual storytelling through data and mapping
- Data-driven approaches to public space, mobility & environment
- Urban planning & city design 🏙️
- Geographic Information Systems (QGIS, GeoPandas)
- Walkable, bikeable cities & green infrastructure 🌿


---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills I use:
- **Python** (Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **SQL**
- **QGIS** for spatial data & cartography
- **Jupyter Notebooks**, GitHub
- Data cleaning, exploration, visualization
- Fluent in **French**, **English**, and **Chinese**

---

## 🧪 Selected Projects:
- 📍 *Mapping vegan-friendly places in Marseille* (QGIS + OSM)
- 🏘️ *Urban housing density analysis in Shanghai* (Python + GeoData)
- 🚲 *Exploration of bikeability features in urban networks*
- 📊 *Real estate data cleaning + regression modeling*
- 🔎 *SQL dashboards for urban performance indicators*

> More to come: I’m currently working on projects that connect urban planning, data, and creativity.

---

## 💼 Looking for:
A **6-month internship** (starting Jan. 2026) in **urban planning**, **urban data analysis**, or **sustainable cities** — ideally combining **technical skills, creativity**, and real-world impact.
